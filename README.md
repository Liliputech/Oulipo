## Eodermdrome
http://oulipo.net/fr/contraintes/eodermdrome

Usage : python eodermdrome.py [dictfile]

Prints all eodermdrome which are present in the dict file.

The dictfile must be formatted with one word per line, ASCII encoding (python doesn't like accent too much).

At the time of writing the script is able to print out eodermdrome made of two words of respectively 5 and 6 letters.

Special thanks to ABO le tch√®que for the design of the main algorithm!
